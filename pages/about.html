    <h1>About</h1>
    
    Hi! I'm an independent artist sharing my passion to music through the instrumental tracks I create. I'm inspired by various genres and styles, and I love experimenting with different sounds to craft the desired vibe. My main instruments are electric guitar and synthesizers, but I also enjoy incorporating other instruments and electronic elements into my music.

    I'm open to collaborations and suggestions, so feel free to reach out!
